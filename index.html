        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a .NET, iOS, and Android software developer. Prior to becoming a software developer my focus was in the medical field. I have completed over 3500 hours in hospitals, nursing homes, and even partook in surgical observations. I worked part-time setting appointments for doctors office's and dispatching urgent messages to physicians.</p> 
        <p>I enrolled into an online front-end web-development tech degree program. After enrolling seats opened up at a local in person coding boot camp where I enrolled and began my journey as a Full-Stack Developer. The boot camp was a 20 week program and pushed me to the limits. I learn new technologies such as python, C#, and SQL. We were assingned multiple projects and were expected to submit them on a weekly basis. I graduated from <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/lc101" target="_blank">Launch_Code</a> in February 2020.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <h3>Insuresoft</h3>
        <p>As a VB.NET Developer, I was responsible for creating software on the Diamond Platform. Our software aimed to assist property and casualty providers in quoting, onboarding, and billing their customers. My primary role was to develop the custom UI for our new implementations using various tools such as Visual Basic, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, XML, and SQL. Additionally, I updated the rating algorithms and new upcoming rates for our current customers. I was also a part of the dev standards team, where we prioritized standardizing our code, creating proper procedures, and writing documentation for our developers.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience (continued...)</h2>       

        <h3>Universal Consulting Services (UCS) - a Tria Federal Company</h3>
        <p>I worked as a C#.NET Developer and was responsible for maintaining the Limited Duty Sailor and Marine Readiness Tracker (LIMDU SMART) system for the US Navy. This system is used in Military Hospitals and is part of the BUREAU of Medicine. It has integration with multiple Military Health System (MHS) systems. I was granted Security Clearance on July 14th, 2022. My main focus was on adding new functionality to the platform, fixing bugs, and writing SQL scripts. The current technology stack includes C#, .NET Framework, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, XML, Entity Framework, and SQL Server as a backend data store, which is deployed to Azure.</p>

        </ul>        

        <h3>MDM Commercial (JourneyPX Division)</h3>
        <p>I created a native iOS app using Swift and an Android app using Java. The purpose of the app is to connect hospital patients with their loved ones through a Smart TV equipped with a camera. This feature enables patients to engage in video calls with their friends and family members while they are in the hospital. Our app was featured on CBS News Chicago, which showcased St. Anthony's Hospital using it in the Mother Baby Unit.</p>

        </ul>    
        <p>In addition, I implemented dynamic links that allow family members to click on a single link they receive via text, which then takes them to their respective mobile app store. If the link is clicked on a PC, they are directed to the company's webpage.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>My focus on our .NET project was to migrate us from .NET 7 to .NET 8. I also worked on creating a program that generates reports for offline devices in the hospitals and sends our technician an email when a new device goes offline and a weekly email showing all devices currently offline.</p>
            
        <p>I worked on a three-person development team, where we focused on implementation, testing, code review, and deployment via CI/CD in Azure DevOps.</p>
